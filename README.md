Our project is DocDash. DocDash is a mobile and web application designed to connect users with healthcare professionals,
giving them the option to book appointments for scheduled visits or urgent care, all while being beneficiary
to the convenience of the customers' homes. It provides an intuitive platform where the user can search for
doctors based on their specialization, location, availability, and specifications. With various functionalities,
DocDash improves the user experience, including filtering professionals, managing user profiles with
personal and medical information, and communicating directly with doctors, via video meets and in-app
messaging. The user will be able to pay for these services through secured payment gateways, along with
using reviews, ratings, and doctor profile features.
